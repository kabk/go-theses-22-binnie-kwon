            <p>This thesis explores the phenomenon of uncanny through the research of its norm in 
                philosophy and psychoanalysis in relation to its aesthetic expression. In doing so,
                the unexpected possibility of uncanny as the tool for expanding our visual potential
                will be inspected.<br><br>
                The anxious weirdness from unfamiliarity is a universal experience. We call it uncanny.
                <i>Everything is uncanny that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light.</i>
                This psychological norm comes from disorientation that is widely expressed through surreal
                symbols in visual arts. Despite the attempt to be brought out on the surface of consciousness,
                the uncanny is still considered as a marginalised area that cannot be verbally explained.<br><br>
                Existing notions around uncanny are mostly unpleasant or negative — its boundaries are uncertain. 
                I perceive it as the opened door that allows unplanned changes to come inside. My personal
                 vulnerability towards this inexplicable anxiety has been discussed in my visual language through 
                 the metaphoric and symbolic images. It leads me to the curiosities on the origin of such uncanny mood,
                 its translation into visuals in popular cultures such as cinema and surrealism.<br><br>
                 This thesis will follow the process to find the answer to the question: How does losing 
                 direction in uncanny bring serendipitous discovery? I aim to form a positive expectation 
                 of uncanny from the new perspective. The book ‘Heidegger on Being Uncanny’ and ‘The Uncanny’ 
                 will be the primary references to examine the conceptual uncanny, and ‘Man and His Symbols’ and ‘High Weirdness’ 
                 will be referred to uncanny aesthetics. The uncanny aesthetics and its visual potential will be examined through 
                 the examples in surrealism paintings and scenography.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

                 <p>
                The late spring in the year 2020 was weirdest period I could ever had. 
                The streets I walk every day were empty, my friends became potential virus infectors.
                 The weirdest part was my hands — I was being highly conscious of the most common part of my body.
                  The pandemic has been continued for a couple of years. Our ordinary life has been threatened 
                  and the dramatic changes we’ve faced threw us into the enormous uncertainty that we even have no 
                  sense of when it will end. What we’ve felt was something more fundamental than just being afraid 
                  of losing your job or health. It was the unrealistic weirdness that comes from separation from 
                  the environments and the relationships we were familiar with.<br><br>

                Although this planetary experience is something unusual, these sorts of emotions are universal. In life, there is a moment we are overwhelmed by unfamiliarity. It happens when the things we know disappear and recognise the fact that we actually don’t know the essence of what we’ve thought we know. Comfort replaces with sudden fear and such a moment breaks our reality as if we can never make our lives and our world fully familiar, fully meaningful. Any meaningfulness we win is haunted by meaninglessness. This weird experience has been defined as the term ‘uncanny’ in various studies from psychoanalysis to aesthetics. 
                
                […]This word appears to express that someone to whom something ‘uncanny’ happens is not quite ‘at home’ or ‘at ease’ in the situation concerned, that the thing is or at least seems to be foreign to him. In brief, the word suggests that a lack of orientation is bound up with the impression of the uncanniness of a thing or incident.
                
                Eernst Jentsch used the term for the first time in his essay ‘On the Psychology of the Uncanny’ and later Sigmund Freud(1856-1939) developed it as ‘the return of the repressed’. For him uncanny status which brings anxiety with it since the act of repression converts any emotion attending what is repressed to anxiety. Martin Heidegger(1917–1976) described uncanny as ‘how one feels’ in the mood of angst and things that were familiar and homely become strange in this mood. In the mood of angst, things that were familiar and homely become strange. The world in which we make our home suddenly seems alien to us. With these notions, uncanny has been regarded as something we are not willing to encounter but we have to. 
                
                Unfamiliarity, unease, unsettled, uncomforted, unhomeliness… There are plenty of words describing uncanny. As you already feel, the connotations of uncanny are more about unpleasant experience because they are based on uncertainty. However, the uncertainty in uncanny inheres its expandability. The primitive example can be found in its notion articulated by Freud. 
                
                It is only rarely that a psychoanalyst feels impelled to investigate the subject of aesthetics even when aesthetics is understood to mean not merely the theory of beauty, but the theory of the qualities of feeling.
                
                He expands aesthetics, which has been traditionally limited to the theory of beauty, to the theory of the qualities of feeling(Lehre von Qualitäten unseres Fühlens), or Aisthesis, that deals with the hatred or embarrassment which were alienated from traditional aesthetics. With this convergence, the uncanny feelings expanded to aesthetics and bring enormous potential through aesthetically expression. The uncanny has been expressed with the particular images through stories, spaces, atmospheres, and moods as peculiar genres. A Myriad of artists has been finding their direction uncanny through its aesthetical expression.
                
                It is paradoxical yet fascinating that we find direction in disorientation. How could this accidental and fortunate discovery be made? What kind of discovery in uncanny aesthetics? These questions will be examined by zooming in on the multidisciplinary notions surrounding uncanny through the research of Freud, Heidegger, and Jung. I will investigate several qualities of uncanny to find the valid associations with its accidental discovery. Furthermore, the aesthetic uncanny will be investigated with the visual expandability focused on surrealism and scenography. The process will be a journey to find a good exit in a maze of uncanny.
